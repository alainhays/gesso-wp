# About Gesso

Gesso is a [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)-based starter theme that outputs
accessible HTML5 markup. It uses a mobile-first responsive approach and
leverages [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) for style organization. This
encourages a component-based approach to theming through the creation of
discrete, reusable UI elements.

Gesso (pronounced JEH-so) is an art term for the white paint mixture used to prepare a canvas or sculpture for painting. Likewise, the Gesso theme prepares WordPress frontend markup and styles to give us a clean starting point.

# About Timber

[Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) helps you create fully-customized WordPress themes faster with more sustainable code. With Timber, you write your HTML using the [Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html) separate from your PHP files. This cleans-up your theme code so your PHP file can focus on supplying the data and logic, while your twig file can focus 100% on the display and HTML.
